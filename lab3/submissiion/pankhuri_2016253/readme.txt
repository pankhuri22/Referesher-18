here i have written an assembly language code for add function that is used in the c program to add two numbers.
rdi and rsi are two registers that are used to take input from user as entered. so whenever we change the value of a and in b in sum.c it changes the value of the two parameters for the add function .
rax and rbx are two registers that store the value of rsi and rdi in them.
finally we add the two values stored in rax and rbx to get our final output and return.
